# Tic-Tac-Toe Game Project

## Project Overview
This project implements a Tic-Tac-Toe game, allowing players to play against AI and supporting Bluetooth connection between multiple devices. The game uses the Minimax algorithm and Alpha-Beta pruning to achieve intelligent decision-making, and provides different difficulty modes (easy, medium, and hard) to meet the needs of players.

## Functional Description
1. **Single-player mode**: Users can choose different difficulties to play against AI, and the difficulty affects the decision-making mode of AI.
2. **Bluetooth multiplayer mode**: Allows Bluetooth connection between two devices, transmits data in JSON format, and supports real-time battles.
3. **Game interface**: Contains home page, settings interface, historical game record display page, etc.
4. **Audio feedback**: Provides sound effects for game wins and losses and other key operations.
5. **User settings and data storage**: Users can adjust the difficulty of the game, and historical game records are still saved after exiting.

## Instructions
1. **Installation**: Clone the GitHub repository and open the project with Android Studio.
2. **Run**: Connect your Android device, open the project and select Run.
3. **Bluetooth connection**: Pair the devices in Bluetooth settings and start multiplayer mode to establish a connection.

## Future improvements
- Improve the efficiency of AI algorithms and optimize decision-making speed.
- Enhance the stability of Bluetooth connections and the security of data transmission.
